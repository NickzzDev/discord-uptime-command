# discord-uptime-command
Shows Uptime of the discord bot! 

This command is for discord.js v13, and I will only be providing v13, but feel free to edit it if your on v12!

I have put my GitHub credits in the description, and would appreciate it if you keep it there, as I coded this myself, and will be providing this to you at ease! 

Thanks, and Hope you Enjoy!
